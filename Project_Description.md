# Week-by-Week/Milestone Progress

## **Milestone 1**: Foundation/Basics
### Task: Python File Operations for Document Handling and LLM Prompt Engineering Exercises
1. Basic Python programming and API integration.
2. Explored LLM models like [Groq](https://console.groq.com/playground).
3. Experimented with various models, system prompts, user prompts, and parameters in the Groq playground.
4. Implemented the [Streamlit API](https://streamlit.io/).

## **Milestone 2**: Advanced Concept Development
### Task: Implement Basic Vector Database Operations and Create an Interface for the Summary Tab
1. Understand machine learning basics and RAG systems, including their architecture.
2. Implement vector databases in the project, such as [FAISS](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/) (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
3. Use [Groq](https://console.groq.com/playground) for summarizing legal documents input by the user into the [Streamlit UI](https://streamlit.io/).
4. Implement the summary section on a new tab of the [Streamlit UI](https://streamlit.io/).

## **Milestone 3**: Advanced Concept Development
### Task: Document Processing and Risk Detection
1. Implement a chatbot using prompts in [Groq](https://console.groq.com/playground).
2. Deploy LLMs for clause extraction.
3. Develop risk scoring algorithms (severity + likelihood).
4. Integrate compliance checklists.
5. Display related websites (e.g., GDPR/HIPAA).

## **Milestone 4**: Full Integration and Deployment
### Task: Achieve Full System Integration and Prepare for Deployment
1. Connect analysis modules to Streamlit.
2. Attach visualizations for risk assessment.
3. Use [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) for deployment.
4. Set up environment variables in the secrets tab on Hugging Face to store API keys.
5. Integrate email automation using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us), allowing users to input their email addresses to receive downloadable PDFs.
6. Deploy the model on Hugging Face after setting up all functionalities.
